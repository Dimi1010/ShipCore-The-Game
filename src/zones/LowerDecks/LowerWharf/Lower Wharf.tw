Pungent with the smell of engine fuel and sea brine synthetics, the Lower Wharf is the underbelly of interstellar trade. Rusting freighters dock alongside sleek smugglers' craft, the air echoing with the clang of metal and shout of loaders. Furtive figures negotiate in shadowed corners, conducting transactions best left unscrutinized.

Lights flicker across stacked containers, creating a patchwork of light and darkness. The distant hum of machinery is a constant reminder of the ceaseless commerce that flows through the veins of MOR-1. Here, goods from across the galaxy exchange hands, legally or otherwise, before disappearing into the labyrinth of the station.

Despite the hustle, there's a sense of impermanence to the Lower Wharf. Everything is in transitâ€”people, goods, dreams. The wharf's myriad pathways stand ready to take you to the heart of the Lower Decks or further into its depths.
