<p>Dalton's presence is a stark contrast to the disarray of the Ruined Hallway. His posture is rigid, a testament to his military background, and his eyes carry the weight of someone who has seen too much yet refuses to look away from adversity. As he approaches, the dim lighting of the hallway casts angular shadows across his face, accentuating his determined expression.</p>

Dalton nods, understanding the urgency in your voice.

Dalton leans in closer, lowering his voice.
<<say 'Dalton' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/dalton.jpg'>>"The dojo's a start. They're not the most skilled, but they've got heart. Or you could try the bars for people to hire."<</say>>
<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"With what money?"<</say>>
Dalton chuckles softly.
<<say 'Dalton' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/dalton.jpg'>>"It'll be rough starting out, but once you've got some people, you can start building your own business. Compete with Braxton. That'll bring in more credits to hire more people... and eventually, we might be able to stop him from tearing down Leina's dojo and make the lower decks safer."<</say>>

Dalton's eyes light up with a spark of hope.

Dalton gives you a calculating look.

Dalton nods, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.
