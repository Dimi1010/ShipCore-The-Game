The echoes of Braxton's laughter still ring in your ears as you lie on the cold, unforgiving metal floor. Pain wracks your body with each shallow breath, and the taste of iron fills your mouth. You're alone, left for dead in the bowels of the station.

With a Herculean effort, you drag yourself to the relative safety of a dark corner. The shadows envelop you, offering a meager shroud from further harm. You curl up, trying to still your ragged breathing and steady the pounding in your skull.

Time loses meaning as you rest in the darkness, the chill of the metal seeping into your bones. Just as you begin to drift into a fitful sleep, a noise startles you back to harsh realityâ€”a footstep? Your heart hammers against your ribs, stress spiking once more.

Peering through the gloom, you make out a figure approaching. He doesn't seem threatening, moving with a cautious gait, his hands clearly visible and empty. The man stops a few feet away, watching you with an expression that's hard to read in the dim light.
