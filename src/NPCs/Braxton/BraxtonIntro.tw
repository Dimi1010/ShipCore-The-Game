As you navigate the dimly lit corridors of the lower decks, the sense of unease grows. The grimy walls close in, and the shadows seem to move with a life of their own. The air is thick with the scent of rust and something elseâ€”something foul.

Suddenly, a group of figures block your path, their postures menacing. The leader, a hulking brute with a scarred face, steps forward. His eyes glint with malice, and his goons fan out behind him, cracking their knuckles.

<br><<changemoods "stress" "major" "NegEffectOnPlayer">><br>
You can feel the threat in the air, as tangible as the grime on the walls.
<br><br>
<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"I'm just passing through. No trouble."<</say>>
<br>
Braxton laughs, a sound that echoes off the metal surfaces, sending chills down your spine.
<br><br>
<<say 'Braxton' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/braxton.jpg'>>"No trouble... Boys, looks like we got ourselves a comedian."<</say>>

<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"What do you want?"<</say>>
<br>
Braxton's grin widens, revealing a set of crooked teeth.
<br><br>
<<say 'Braxton' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/braxton.jpg'>>"Your credits, your gear, and maybe a bit of fun. Don't worry, we'll make it quick."<</say>>

His goons move in, and you know that talking is no longer an option. It's time to fight or flee.
<br><br>
<<say 'Braxton' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/braxton.jpg'>>"Get 'em, boys!"<</say>><br><br>
