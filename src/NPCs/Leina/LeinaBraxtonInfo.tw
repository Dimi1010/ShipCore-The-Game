<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"Leina, I wanted to talk about Braxton. Who is he, and why is he a problem for the dojo?"<</say>>
<p>Leina pauses, her expression turning solemn. She gestures for you to follow her to a quieter corner of the dojo.</p>

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"Braxton is a local gang leader. He and his crew have been trying to control the lower decks through fear and violence. They don't like that we teach self-defense here. It undermines their power."<</say>>
<p>Her fists clench at her sides, a subtle sign of the anger she feels towards the man and his actions.</p>

<<set $player.stress += 5>> /* The tension of the topic slightly increases your stress */
<<changemoods "stress" "minor" "NegEffectOnPlayer">><br>
<<set $player.mood -= 5>> /* The gravity of the situation dampens your mood */
<<changemoods "mood" "minor" "NegEffectOnPlayer">><br>

<p>Leina leads you to a wall where a series of images are displayed, each one marked as 'missing.' If Braxton's thugs had been more thorough, then there was every likelihood that your name could have been added to the listâ€”if you had known anyone, that is. There wouldn't really have been anyone to put up a poster for you, after all.</p>
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"These are the people who have stood up to him and paid the price. We honor their courage here. And we prepare so that no one else becomes a victim."<</say>>
<p>You look at the images, each one a reminder of the danger that lurks in the lower decks.</p>
