After the training session, you approach Leina, who has just finished instructing a particularly difficult maneuver to an advanced student. She wipes a bead of sweat from her brow and turns to you with an inviting smile.

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"I can see the curiosity in your eyes. What is it you wish to know?"<</say>><br>
Her office is a small extension of the dojo, lined with holopictures of past champions and shelves of ancient texts on martial arts.

<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"I want to know more about you and how this dojo came to be. It's a place of hope in a rather bleak environment."<</say>><br>
Leina gestures to a pair of cushioned mats on the floor, inviting you to sit as she begins her tale.

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"My story is not unlike many you'll find here in the lower decks. I was born into hardship, but I refused to let it define me. This dojo is my rebellion against the despair that grips this place."<</say>><br>
As she speaks, her eyes reflect the fire of her spirit, and you find yourself drawn into her narrative.

<<set $player.stress -= 5>> /* Listening to Leina's inspiring story reduces stress */
<<changemoods "stress" "minor" "PosEffectOnPlayer">><br>
<<set $player.mood += 10>> /* The connection with Leina and her story improves your mood */
<<changemoods "mood" "minor" "PosEffectOnPlayer">><br>

Leina stands and moves to a wall, touching a holopicture of a young girl standing beside an older, battle-scarred warrior.
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"This was my mentor, Master Chen. He saw potential in me when I was just a scrappy kid getting into fights. He taught me discipline, control, and the art of combat."<</say>><br>
You watch as her hand lingers on the image, her respect for the man evident in her reverent touch.

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"When he passed, I inherited his legacy. This dojo is as much his as it is mine. I've dedicated my life to teaching others what he taught meâ€”to give them strength to face whatever comes their way."<</say>><br>
Leina's words resonate with you, and you feel a surge of respect for her dedication.

<<set $player.health += 5>> /* The peaceful atmosphere of the office has a restorative effect on your health */
<<changemoods "health" "minor" "PosEffectOnPlayer">><br>

She returns to her seat, her gaze meeting yours with an intensity that speaks of her commitment to her cause.
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"But it's not just about fighting. It's about building a community, about finding a family among those who have none. We protect each other here."<</say>><br>
Her words paint a picture of unity and strength, and you feel a sense of belonging begin to take root within you.

<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"It's more than I expected. I'm grateful to be a part of it, even if just for a short while."<</say>><br>
Leina nods, her smile warm and genuine.
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"You're welcome here for as long as you need, <<=$player.name>>. We all have our paths, but they're easier to walk with allies by our side."<</say>><br>

You rise from the mat, feeling a newfound sense of purpose and camaraderie. Leina's story has given you insight into the heart of the dojo and the spirit of the people who train here.

<<say '$player.name' $playerPortraitPathZ>>"Thank you, Leina. I won't forget this conversation."<</say>><br>
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"Nor will I. Now, go rest. Tomorrow's training awaits."<</say>><br>

You exit her office, the echoes of Leina's story accompanying you as you navigate the corridors of the lower decks, your spirit lifted and your resolve strengthened.
