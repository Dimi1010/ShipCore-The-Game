<p>Leina gestures to a pair of cushioned mats on the floor, inviting you to sit as she begins her tale.</p>

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"My story is not unlike many you'll find here in the lower decks. I was born into hardship, but I refused to let it define me. This dojo is my rebellion against the despair that grips this place."<</say>>
<p>As she speaks, her eyes reflect the fire of her spirit, and you find yourself drawn into her narrative.</p>

<<set $player.stress -= 5>> /* Listening to Leina's inspiring story reduces stress */

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"This was my mentor, Master Chen. He saw potential in me when I was just a scrappy kid getting into fights. He taught me discipline, control, and the art of combat."<</say>>
<p>You watch as her hand lingers on the image, her respect for the man evident in her reverent touch.</p>

<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"When he passed, I inherited his legacy. This dojo is as much his as it is mine. I've dedicated my life to teaching others what he taught meâ€”to give them strength to face whatever comes their way."<</say>>
<p>It's easy to see how words would resonate with many, especially the desperate on the lower decks.</p>

<<set $player.health += 5>> /* The peaceful atmosphere of the office has a restorative effect on your health */
<<changemoods "health" "minor" "PosEffectOnPlayer">>

<p>She returns to her seat, her gaze meeting yours with an intensity that speaks of her commitment to her cause.</p>
<<say 'Leina' setup.ImagePath+'characters/lowerdecks/leina.jpg'>>"But it's not just about fighting. It's about building a community, about finding a family among those who have none. We protect each other here."<</say>>
<p>Her words paint a picture of unity and strength.</p>
