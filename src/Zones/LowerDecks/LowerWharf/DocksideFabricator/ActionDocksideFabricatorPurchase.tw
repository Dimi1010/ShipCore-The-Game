<<say 'Lucas Radiz' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/minor/lucasradiz.jpg'>>"Excellent decision, spacer. Let me show you around your new domain of creation. You'll see, it's more than just machines and metalâ€”it's potential."<</say>>

Lucas guides you past the threshold where the public area ends and the heart of the fabricator begins. The space is a hive of activity, with machines of all sizes whirring and clicking in a mechanical symphony. Overhead, a network of conveyor belts moves parts to and fro, a testament to the organized chaos that is the lifeblood of this place.

<<say 'Lucas Radiz' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/minor/lucasradiz.jpg'>>"Here's the main fabrication floor. You'll have access to these stations for your projects. We keep our equipment state-of-the-art, recalibrated daily for precision. You won't find a finer setup on this side of the sector."<</say>>

You can't help but be impressed by the array of fabricators, each humming with the promise of creation. Lucas points out a terminal where orders are placed, and a collection bin where the finished products can be retrieved. It's all incredibly efficient, and you begin to understand the cost of entry.

A side door leads to a quieter room lined with lockers and benches. Lucas explains that this is where clients can store materials or take a break. The lockers are sturdy, designed to keep valuable scrap and parts secure.

<<say 'Lucas Radiz' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/minor/lucasradiz.jpg'>>"Your materials will be safe here, and you can access them any time. The service drones will store or fetch them as needed from the Lockbox Hub."<</say>>

As Lucas's tour concludes, he hands you a data slate with your access codes and a map of the facility. The weight of the slate in your hand feels like a key to a new chapter in your journey.

<<say 'Lucas Radiz' setup.ImagePath+'/characters/minor/lucasradiz.jpg'>>"If you need any assistance, my team and I are always on hand. We're here to ensure everything runs smoothly for you. It's what we get paid for, after all."<</say>>

With a final nod, Lucas leaves you to absorb the sights and sounds of your new enterprise. The fabricators continue their work, indifferent to your presence but awaiting your command.
