<!-- The room description is adjusted to color only strategic words for flavor based on the station's economy and danger level -->
The room of your awakening in is a capsule of function over formâ€”a stark berth within the arteries of the starport. The metal bench, deriving from the floor itself, is the room's sole concession to <span style="color: lightblue;">rest</span>.

<!-- Economy-based descriptions -->
<<if $worldEconomyScore >= 800>>
    The walls, <span style="color: green;">polished</span> to a high sheen, resonate with the prosperity of the station.
<<elseif $worldEconomyScore >= 600>>
    Soft <span style="color: lightgreen;">illumination</span> from well-placed LEDs casts a calming ambiance.
<<elseif $worldEconomyScore >= 400>>
    A <span style="color: orange;">flicker</span> here and there in the lighting speaks to the occasional scarcity.
<<elseif $worldEconomyScore >= 200>>
    The dim <span style="color: red;">glow</span> from the lights paints a picture of economic downturn.
<<else>>
    Sparse <span style="color: darkred;">lighting</span> gives the compartment a grim aspect.
<</if>>

<!-- Danger level-based descriptions -->
<<if $dangerLevelScore >= 800>>
    The station's outer hull is a <span style="color: blue;">serene</span> backdrop.
<<elseif $dangerLevelScore >= 600>>
    It denotes a <span style="color: lightblue;">moderate</span> level of activity, both tranquil and alert.
<<elseif $dangerLevelScore >= 400>>
    Frequent <span style="color: orange;">flashes</span> of patrolling security craft hint at higher risks.
<<elseif $dangerLevelScore >= 200>>
    The occasional <span style="color: red;">siren</span> and rapid movement of ships suggest heightened danger.
<<else>>
    The sight of <span style="color: darkred;">debris</span> and defensive fortifications speaks to extreme dangers.

If you wanted, you could try to take a nap here in the corner. Won't be comfortable, though.

        <p>The room reminds you of Jax, bringing a tinge of sadness with the memory.</p>
    <<elseif $JaxRecruitmentPlot == 0>>
        <!-- Jax's recruitment plot is not active -->
        <p>Jax has made himself at home, piling up junk and building a nest in the corner of the Cold Storage room. His presence, or maybe some unknown hand of security, seems to be keeping this place clear of the normal lower deck riffraff. You could ask him some questions if you want.</p>

            <p>Jax seems to be giving you space, respecting your earlier decision to reject his offer. He's immersed in his work, but you notice a glance in your direction, as if he's still hopeful you might reconsider. If you've had a change of heart, now might be the time to let him know.</p>

            <!-- Know Jax Join Condition -->
            <p>Jax looks up briefly as you enter, a questioning look in his eyes. He's surrounded by equipment, but it's clear he's anticipating your acquisition of a Nano-doc. Maybe it's time to discuss your plans.</p>

            <!-- Rejected Jax's offer -->
            <p>Despite your rejection, Jax doesn't seem to hold it against you. He's busy with his gadgets, but there's an unspoken invitation in his posture, suggesting he's open to talking if you are. Perhaps you could explore other ways to work together.</p>

        <<else>>
            <!-- Default case if no specific condition is met -->
            <p>Jax is busy sorting through various bits of tech and gear, clearly planning something. He seems focused on the task at hand, perhaps waiting for an update from you. You could ask him some questions if you want.</p>
