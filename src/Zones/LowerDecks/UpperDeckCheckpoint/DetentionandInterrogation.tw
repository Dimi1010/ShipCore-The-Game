There is nothing to do here at the moment.

Travel:

The Detention and Interrogation sector of MOR-1 is a place many fear, but few see. The walls here are thick, designed to muffle the sounds within. Stark lighting casts harsh shadows, and the air carries a chill that has little to do with temperature control.

Security officers lead detainees through reinforced doors into soundproofed rooms. The only decorations are the unyielding restraints and the steel tables where much of the station's darker business is conducted â€” extracting information by whatever means necessary.

[[Return to the Security Command Center|Security Command Center][$timeadd = 5]]

This is a dead end by design, a place meant for inquisition and containment. There are no other exits, only the way back to the command hub from which all surveillance and security thread together in the ever-watchful eyes of MOR-1's Security Command Center.
