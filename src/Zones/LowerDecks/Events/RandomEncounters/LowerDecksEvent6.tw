The encounter leaves you with a heavy sense of dread, and you can't help but quicken your pace.</p>

You hold your breath, hoping not to become collateral damage in someone else's fight. After what feels like an eternity, the groups disperse, leaving the corridor in an uneasy silence. The incident leaves you with a lingering sense of unease that clings to you like the station's recycled air.</p>
